# Shop Minis UI Extensions - Code Guidelines

## General Guidelines

1. **Use TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and better maintainability.
2. **Follow Functional Component Pattern**: Use functional components and React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for component names, and UPPER_CASE for constants.
4. **Documentation**: Document components, functions, and significant code blocks using JSDoc comments.
5. **Imports**: Group and order imports logically. Separate external library imports from internal module imports.

## Code Structure

1. **Component Organization**: Organize components in a logical and modular manner. Each component should reside in its own file.
2. **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent file names. Component files should be named after the component they export (e.g., `BundleCollection.tsx`).

## Component Guidelines

1. **Props and State**: Define prop types and state using TypeScript interfaces and types.
2. **Default Props**: Provide default values for props when applicable.
3. **Memoization**: Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
4. **Keys for Lists**: Always provide a unique `key` prop for list items to ensure efficient rendering.

## Styling and Theming

1. **Use Theme**: Utilize the theme provided by the Shop Minis SDK for consistent styling.
2. **Spacing and Layout**: Use the `Box` component and theme spacing values for layout and spacing.
3. **Typography**: Use the `Text` component and its variants for consistent typography.

## Accessibility

1. **Accessible Components**: Ensure all components are accessible and provide necessary accessibility props.
2. **Semantic Markup**: Use semantic elements and proper ARIA roles to enhance accessibility.

## Performance

1. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for components and data fetching where applicable.
2. **Optimized Rendering**: Use `FlatList`, `SectionList`, and other optimized list components for rendering large datasets.

## Error Handling

1. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
2. **User Feedback**: Provide clear and actionable feedback to users in case of errors.
